# GitHub API Browser Project

## Build

This project was created using **create-react-app** command so it can be built using the **npm install** command and it will automatically download all the node modules needed to run the program.

## Run

To run the program just press the command **npm start**.

## Test

To run the tests, use the **npm test** command.

## Annotations.

This program was made and tested using a user key of this API (token). To be able to run it in this way, you only have to create an .env file in the root of the project and put the following code inside:
```
REACT_APP_GHT = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

This way you can access 5000 api requests in one hour, otherwise you only have 60 requests in one hour.

One improvement that can be made to this program is to implement a tree system for file navigation.
